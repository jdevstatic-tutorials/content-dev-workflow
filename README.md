# My Personal Content Dev Workflow
GitHub lets you create digital content
easily as it is using Markdown. That 
really fits for digital content writers,
even for non-code.

When I'm doing a content that is like
a tutorial, I have my personal 
workflow, so that I am always efficient.

The very first rule is that, everything
should be online, even the drafts of 
my content, so that I can access that
everywhere. The only downside is that,
if there is no connection, I really 
don't have access to my online content
unless I have an offline backup.

GitHub really is there as my active
site development more than Google Docs
or Microsoft Word. I have covered
this in one of my posts:

The most important catch is that
you want your content as a plaintext 
format and let it be rendered for
different versions and platforms.
Plus, when you put your content in 
GitHub, it is really an efficient
tracking the version of your file
particularly when others
are collaborating with your work.
But even if I'm just alone, it's 
really the best for me. Other
writers believe that too.
