# My Personal Content Dev Workflow
GitHub lets you create digital content
easily as it is using Markdown. That 
really fits for digital content writers,
even for non-code.

When I'm doing a content that is like
a tutorial, I have my personal 
workflow, so that I am always efficient.

The very first rule is that, everything
should be online, even the drafts of 
my content, so that I can access that
everywhere. The only downside is that,
if there is no connection, I really 
don't have access to my online content
unless I have an offline backup.

GitHub really is there as my active
site development more than Google Docs
or Microsoft Word. I have covered
this in one of my posts:

The most important catch is that
you want your content as a plaintext 
format and let it be rendered for
different versions and platforms.
Plus, when you put your content in 
GitHub, it is really an efficient
tracking the version of your file
particularly when others
are collaborating with your work.
But even if I'm just alone, it's 
really the best for me. Other
writers believe that too.

I tested several workflows of my
own and I want it to be simple as
possible. I tried using GitHub 
Desktop and VS Code or GitHub Gist
as additional tools, 
but it's not that simple.
Don't get me wrong, they are great
technologies but the way I want it
is as simple as possible. So, 
this workflow that I am adhering
too, I am using this whenever
I am creating digital content
for students.

Firstly, I will start creating
a repo here in GitHub and set it
to `private` first. For me, for every
content is a separate repo, no
matter how short the content is.
I will be putting all my 
initial thoughts.
This is still a draft even though
I am using the `main` branch because
this is still private. The 
default `README.md` is the page
actually and it should be the only
one formy content.

Then, say, I feel that I'm done with
the content, this time, of course, 
I need to proofread, for spelling
and grammar and the structure of the
content itself. I found it out that
the simplest way of doing this
is to use Google Docs. I will be
copy and paste the rendered content
in Google Docs. Don't get me wrong,
I am not using this for the content, 
it is just to check particularly for
spelling. Also, you will see the
structure of your content easily
there.
